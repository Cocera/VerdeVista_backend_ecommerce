# VerdeVista / E-Commerce API Project

Welcome to the E-Commerce API project! 
The main objective is to build the backend of an ecommerce dedicated to the sale of plants online.
This project combines the power of Node.js, Express, MySQL/Sequelize, and various web development technologies to create a robust backend for an online store. As a developer, you will have the opportunity to showcase your skills in building a fully functional RESTful API for an e-commerce platform.

## Technologies used
<ul>
<li><strong>Node.js:</strong> Node.js is the runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server. It's the foundation for building the backend of the application.</li>

<li><strong>Express.js:</strong> Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building robust and scalable APIs. In this project, Express is used for creating routes, handling middleware, and managing HTTP requests and responses.</li>

<li><strong>MySQL:</strong> MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system. It's used for storing and managing structured data, making it a great choice for an e-commerce application where data consistency and relationships are crucial.</li>

<li><strong>Sequelize:</strong> Sequelize is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js. It simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to work with databases using JavaScript objects. It's particularly useful for defining models, managing database schemas, and executing queries.</li>

<li><strong>Bcrypt:</strong> Bcrypt is a password-hashing library used for securely storing user passwords. It helps protect user data by applying a one-way hashing algorithm.</li>

<li><strong>JWT (JSON Web Tokens):</strong> In this project, JWTs are used for user authentication and authorization. They provide a secure way to transmit user identity information between the client and server.</li>

<li><strong>Postman:</strong> A valuable tool for ensuring the correctness and reliability of your API's functionality during development and testing phases, testing API endpoints, making requests, and analyzing responses.</li>
</ul>

<!-- After a thorough analysis of the project's requirements, this API is designed to offer the following key functionalities:

User Registration with password hashing using Bcrypt.
User Login with token-based authentication and middleware.
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products.
Implementation of at least one Many-to-Many and one One-to-Many relationship.
Use of seeders to populate the database with initial data.
Essential Project Requirements
To excel in this project, it is crucial to present an excellent README. The following technologies will be used in the development of this API:

MySQL with Sequelize for the database.
Express for building the API.
The project will be hosted on a public GitHub repository, where branches, high-quality commits, and a comprehensive README are mandatory.
